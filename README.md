# Programming-for-Games-II---Lab-Assignments
This repository functions as the basis for the game I will be working on throughout Y1/S2 of OTU within the Programming for Games II course.  The game I will be working on is a 2D platformer with basic platformer obstacles and possibly enemies. It will be stylized with pixel art.
